Instructions 

In a medium-size pot whisk together soy sauce, water, mirin, rice vinegar, sugar, ginger, garlic, and cornstarch.
Bring mixture to a boil, constantly whisk until sauce is slightly thickened, about 1 minute.
Transfer 1 cup of the sauce to a bowl to use for basting the chicken.
Thread cut pieces of chicken on wooden skewers that have been soaked in water for 30 minutes. Season with salt and pepper on both sides.
Drizzle both sides of skewers with a small amount of oil to prevent sticking when cooking.
Preheat grill over medium-high heat. Use a paper towel dipped in oil to clean and grease the grill grates.
Once the grill is hot add the skewers and cook for 4 minutes. Flip over and baste the cooked side with the sauce. Cook 4 minutes.
Flip skewer over, baste with sauce, cook 2 minutes covered.
Flip skewer over again, baste, cook 2 minutes covered.
Repeat flipping, basting and covered cooking 2 additional times, 16 minutes total cooking time.
